1.Video Streaming Platform using Flask and FFmpeg

2. Objective
To design and develop a user-friendly web application that enables users to upload, stream, and manage video content efficiently. The platform allows real-time video playback, file conversion for web compatibility, and centralized video management using a lightweight backend.

3. Introduction
The growing demand for video content has led to the development of various streaming platforms. This project aims to create a lightweight and functional streaming system suitable for personal use or small-scale video hosting. The application provides essential features such as:

Video upload and storage

Format conversion using FFmpeg

Web-based video streaming

Basic metadata management via SQLite

It can be optionally extended to support AWS S3 for cloud-based video storage.

4. Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
Python	Core programming language
Flask	Web framework for handling routing, templates, and server
SQLite	Lightweight database to store video metadata
FFmpeg	Converts uploaded videos to MP4 format
HTML/CSS	User interface via Flask templates
AWS S3 (Optional)	Cloud video storage

5. System Architecture
Modules:

Frontend (HTML/CSS, Flask Templates)

Upload page

Video list page

Video watch page

Backend (Flask + Python)

Handles routing, file upload, video conversion, database operations

Database (SQLite)

Stores: video ID, title, filename, upload timestamp

Storage

Local storage under static/uploads/ (or AWS S3 if enabled)

6. Key Features
🎞️ Video Upload:
Users can upload videos in any format. Files are saved to the server and converted to .mp4 format using FFmpeg.

📺 Video Streaming:
Videos are streamed in-browser using HTML5 <video> tags.

🗂️ Dashboard/List View:
Shows all uploaded videos with links to play them.

🕒 Metadata Storage:
Video titles, filenames, and upload times are stored in SQLite for management.

☁️ (Optional) AWS S3 Support:
Videos can be uploaded to S3 instead of local storage for scalability.

7. Code Summary
app.py: Main Flask server with routes for uploading, viewing, and listing videos.

config.py: Stores AWS/local path configs and DB path.

db_init.py: Creates the SQLite table structure.

templates/: HTML templates for rendering pages.

static/uploads/: Stores converted videos for playback.

8. Challenges Faced
⚙️ Ensuring all uploaded formats convert smoothly to .mp4

💾 Managing large video files with limited server space

☁️ Optional AWS integration for cloud storage

🔐 Future plans include authentication and access controls

9. Future Enhancements
User authentication (login/signup)

Video search and tagging

Video comments/likes

Dashboard analytics

AWS S3 and CDN integration

Support for live streaming via WebRTC or HLS

10. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how a full-stack video streaming solution can be built using Flask, SQLite, and FFmpeg. It can serve as a foundational prototype for more advanced platforms and can be scaled up using cloud technologies and modern frontend frameworks.
